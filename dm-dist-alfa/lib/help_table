and where he may sell his treasure if he should manage to survive the perils
with his life and sanity intact. Many shops trade only in a specific type of
merchandise. Thus, a baker may well refuse to buy your armor, even if it is of
high quality!
   To some people, the prospect of obtaining the entire inventory of a shop by
murdering the keeper may appear tempting - but beware: The shopkeepers are 
often rugged, capable men; roughened by years of trading and, indeed, surviving
in a world where the only safe prospect is death in the end.

    less experience points

We strongly disencourage killing of other players, but the choice is yours.

must then "follow" the leader using the follow command. The leader should
NOT follow anyone at all! The leader can now toggle group membership for
each player in the group, by using "group <player_name>". The leader
should remember to include himself in the group.

Example:

Quifael and Redferne wishes to group with Dragon.

Quifael : "follow dragon"
Redferne: "follow dragon"
(Dragon should be following no one but himself)
Dragon  : "group dragon"

LINK

A lot of players have problems with their links to the game. This could be
very dangerous to your healt in the middle of a combat. But we have worked
out a solution. There are two cases:

  I.If your link is broken, you will automatically attempt to flee each
    time someone attempts to hit you. If you manage to flee, then you
    will be saved by divine forces, and put in a safe place until you
    reconnect to the game.

 II.If your link jams (freezes) you got a problem. The only solution we
    can give, is that you break your link as quickly as possible. By
    breaking the link you can hope that the above procedure is initiated.

HOUSES


Player Houses in DikuMUD
------------------------

In DikuMUD it is possible for players on all experience levels to purchase a
house in the residential area in the southern part of Midgaard.  As some
areas are more sought after than others, the prices tend to vary quite a bit.
These are the prices for a house with two rooms and an ordinary lock.

                House on Emerald Avenue        : 400,000 coins
                House on Park Road             : 300,000 coins
                House on Elm Street
                      or Penny Lane            : 200,000 coins

Extra rooms can be purchased at 50,000 coins each.

The houses cannot be used directly as one-time rent rooms where multiple
items (like weapons and armour) can be stored, as ordinary items stored in
the house will be lost during a crash or a shutdown.

Instead of risking the loss of your favourite item, it is possible to have
special items manufactured (at a special price, of course) that will be
located somewhere in your house every time you log in.  The price of each
such item has to be decided in each specific case but as a guideline the
ordinary purchase price times ten can be used.

It is also possible to purchase various household equipment to be installed
in a house.  The following list contains prices of the items that are
available at the time of writing.  More are sure to come and if you have any
special wishes, we will do our very best to fulfill them.

                Coffee Machine                 :   5,000 coins
                Tea Macine                     :   5,000 coins
                Coke Machine                   :   5,000 coins
                Water Machine                  :   5,000 coins

The above mentioned machines are all manufactured by Quifatronic Inc. and
produce one unit of the specified drink per game refresh.  All machines are
able to hold three units at a time.

The following special equipment is also installable in any house at the given
prices.

                Magic trashcan (no emptying)   :  25,000 coins
                Pick-safe lock                 :  50,000 coins
                Interdimensional gate          : 100,000 coins (*)
                Magical shielding              : 200,000 coins (**)

(*) An interdimensional gate is a one-way magical portal that leads to a
specific distant location in the world.  When ordering an interdimensional
gate, please state where you want it to lead to.

(**) Magical shielding is a powerful spell that when cast upon a house will
shield its rooms from users of teleport spells, making it impossible from any
mortal to enter (except by the door, of course) unless specifically summoned.

Of course it is possible to have additional rooms and equipment added to an
already existing house.  This means that you do not have to purchase
everything at once but can add new features to your house as you earn more
money and as they become available.
