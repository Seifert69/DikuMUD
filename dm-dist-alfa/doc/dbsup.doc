World File field description:
=============================

Main structure notes:
---------------------

#<virtual number> is:
  A number for the given room. No two rooms may have the same number.
  The <virtual number> must always increase when browsing down the 
  world file (but increments can be larger than one).

<name>~<NL>:
  This name is the "title" of the room. This title is also used in special
  procedures like:
    "exits"
    "brief mode"

<description>~<NL>:
  This is the general description of the room.

<zone nr> is:
  The number of the zone in which this room is located. This number is used
  for resetting zones and monster zone movement. See the zone file.

<room_flags> are:
  A bitvector consisting of the room conditions as:

  DARK           1  Light must be used to see anything.
  DEATH          2  A player 'dies' (no xp lost) when entering.
                    It is a good idea to:
                     *Have these rooms light, because then EXITS will show
                      the room title, for example "In Boiling Water".
                     *Make exits to all rooms from which one can enter the
                      death_room, then the "death cry" will be heard by
                      other members of the group considering following...
  NO_MOB         4  No monsters may walk around in here
  INDOORS        8  This is inside (a house,cave or dungeon for example)
  LAWFULL       16  ??? 
  NEUTRAL       32  ???
  CHAOTIC       64  ???
  NO_MAGIC     128  Not implemented.
  TUNNEL       256  ???
  PRIVATE      512  It is impossible to teleport to this room if it
                    already contains two characters.
                    Also the 'teleport' spell will never teleport a
                    player into this room.

??? means that the flag isn't used yet (and you Shouldn't use it either!)


<sector_type> is:
  This determines how many movement points are used when moving through
  a location of the type - use one of the numbers 0..7 (they are NOT the
  movement-points used - merely indexes to a lookup-table):

  SECT_INSIDE          0  Uses as if walking indoors
  SECT_CITY            1  Uses as if walking in a city
  SECT_FIELD           2  Uses as if walking in a field
  SECT_FOREST          3  Uses as if walking in a forest
  SECT_HILLS           4  Uses as if walking in hills
  SECT_MOUNTAIN        5  Uses as if climbing in mountains
  SECT_WATER_SWIM      6  Uses as if swimming
  SECT_WATER_NOSWIM    7  Impossible to swim water - requires a boat


Direction fields:
-----------------

<Exit number> is one of:
  0 = North
  1 = East
  2 = South
  3 = West
  4 = Up
  5 = Down

<general description><NL>~<NL>:
  What a player will see if he types 'look <direction>'

<keyword list>~<NL>:
  used for commands like 'open', 'close', etc. should be 'door' for ordinary
  doors. Example: An exit from a given room leads through a cupboard. The
  keyword list for this exit might look like this:

  "cupboard door~"


<Door flag> [NL]:

  If <Door Flag> is 1, the exit can be locked/unlocked/opened/closed/picked.
  If it is 2, the exit can only be locked/unlocked/opened/closed.
  If it is 0, these commands won't work. (The exit can still be closed at
  reset, however; maybe to be opened by some special routine, like a concealed
  handle).

  The state of the doors after reset may be controlled by a command in the
  reset-command table (see the zone file). The initial state of a door is
  open.

<Key Number> [NL]:
  The number of the object which can unlock/lock the door (in the direction
  given). If a player carries/holds this object, he can lock/unlock.
  <Key Number> == -1 means no keyhole. If <Door flag> is 0, the value of this
  field is ignored.

<to_room> <NL>:
  The virtual number of the room to which the exit leads. If this number is
  -1 (NOWHERE), the exit doesn't lead anywhere. This might be useful for
  adding an exit-description in a direction which doesn't actually lead
  anywhere.

** Note about doors. You must make a door in both rooms that the door
                     is set between.

Extra descriptions:
-------------------

<blank separated keyword list>~<NL> is:
  A list of the keywords that will allow the extra description to be
  displayed. The keywords must must be seperated by blanks.


<description><NL>~<NL>:
  The description that is show when a player types 'look at <keyword>'
  and keyword matches one of the above.


Example of a room entry is the database:
----------------------------------------

#100
The Lego temple~
   You stand in a tiny, red temple; built entirely from Lego bricks. It is,
sadly, not a very interesting place, and perhaps you should leave through the
portal which leads south to a sunny garden.

Monster fields description:
===========================

#<virtual number><NL> is:
  The monsters virtual number. Rules are same as for room virtual numbers.

<namelist><!NL>~<NL>
  The space-separated name alias list.

<short description><!NL>~<NL>
  This string will be displayed when the monster take action, for example
  if it is "The Beastly Fido", and fido leaves south the message will be
  "The Beastly Fido leaves south."

<long description><NL>~<NL>
  This description is displayed when the monster is in it's "default"
  position. When not in the default position, a message like:
  "<short description> is sleeping here." could be displayed.

<description><NL>~<NL>
  This will be displayed when a player looks at the monster.

<action flags>[NL]

  This bitvector define how the monster behave.  The bits mean:

  ACT_SPEC         1  This means that there is a special programmed C
                      procedure connected to the monster. When this bit
                      is set the monster "function pointer" must be
                      assigned in the "spec_assign.c" file.

  ACT_SENTINEL     2  When this bit is set the monster will NOT
                      move around in the world.

  ACT_SCAVENGER    4  When this bit is set, monsters will pick up stuff
                      lying on the ground. It will pick up the most
                      expensive items first.

  ACT_ISNPC        8  RESERVED FOR INTERNAL USE

  ACT_NICE_THIEF  16  When this bit is set, a monster will not attack
                      a thief which has been caught in the act of 
                      stealing from this monster.

  ACT_AGGRESSIVE  32  When this bit is set, the monster will attack and
                      attempt to kill any player it can get it's claws on.
                      It will not attack players it can't see (for example
                      dark rooms or when player is invisible, unless the
                      monster can detect invisibility)

  ACT_STAY_ZONE   64  When this bit is set, the monster will never move
                      into another zone of the world (this is good for
                      keeping your monsters in your own adventure).

  ACT_WIMPY      128  When this bit is set, the monster will flee when it's
                      getting percentwise low on hitpoints.
                      If the monster is both aggressive and wimpy, then it
                      will only attack players that are NOT awake! (ie. also
                      suffering players).

<affection flags>[NL]

  This is a bitvector that indicates what the monster is affected by.
  Puff could for example be able to "detect invisible" or maybe
  "sanctuary" (1/2 damage). A lot of these bits are meant for players

  +1000 .. +350  Good Alignment
   +349 .. -349  Neutral Alignment
   -350 ..-1000 Evil Alignment

<Detailed/Simple flag><NL>

  This flag must be entered as a uppercase "S". S indicates that "Simple"
  monster data follow. Anything but an S will be interpreted as if
  "Detailed" monster data is to follow. We will NOT describe detailed
  monsters as they are VERY detailed.


<Level>
   This is the level of the monster. See "defs.doc" for guidelines when
   setting the level.

<THAC0>
   The monsters THAC0.
   See the file "defs.doc" for an explanation of armour vs. THAC0, and
   guidelines for THAC0.
   THAC0 is an abbrevation for "To Hit Armour Class Zero".

<AC>
   The monsters armour class. See "defs.doc" for guidelines regarding
   armour.

<Hit Points (format is xdy+z)>
   This defines the number of hitpoints a given monster has. If this is
   entered into the file:

   ... ... 3d8+10 ...

   the monster will have 10 hitpoints plus the result of rolling 3 dice
   with 8 side, and adding their sum. All the numbers (even zero), the
   plus sign, and the letter 'd' MUST be entered!!! Example:

   ..... 1d6+0 ....


<Damage (as HP)><NL>
   This is the damage a monster will cause when it is using NO weapons
   (the Bare hand damage). The format is exacly like the one described
   for hit points. A thing to note about damage:
   The number after the plus sign, is the "strength bonus". This bonus
   will apply to any weapons used, and bare hands too. Example:

   ..... 1d4+10

   This monster will damage between 11 and 14 hitpoints each round. If the
   monster picks up and wields a tiny stick which give 1d2 damage, then the
   monster will now damage by : 1d2 + 10 points.

   is displayed - see above.

<sex><NL>
   This is the monsters sex, on of:

   SEX_NEUTRAL   0

   If the <Item Type> == ITEM_CONTAINER then the values are interpeted as:

      Value[0]: Maximum weight the container can contain.
      Value[1]: Container flags:

        CLOSEABLE     - 1
        PICKPROOF     - 2

                -1 means no lockability.
      Value[3]: Internal use for Corpses that must "rot".


<weight>[NL]
   The weight of the item in pounds.

<value>[NL]
   The value of the item if sold - see "defs.doc" for ideas on prices.

<cost/day><NL>
   The cost to store the item in the reception overnight.




Several extra descriptions or none at all may appear. They follow the room

'E'<NL>
<keyword-list>~<NL>
   Exactly as in rooms.

<extra description><NL>~<NL>
   Exactly as in rooms.



Between zero and two "affect's" may be set on an item. The affects could
for example modify a characters strength, height etc. The affect only goes
into affect when the character wear, wield or hold the item. The affect
is removed when the character removes the items.

'A'<NL>
   When items are worn using wear/wield/grab/hold commands, the 'A' will
   allow the items to affect a characters various abilities. Currently
   a maximum of 2 'A' are allowed.

<location>[NL]
   <location> is one of the below numbers, indicating which ability
   will be changed.

   APPLY_NONE              0  DO NOT USE.
   APPLY_STR               1

<modifier><NL>

   The modifier is added to the APPLY_XXX ability of the character
   when he uses an item, and is subtracted when he stops using it.
   Take great care when using this. This is an example of an item of
   improve strength and armour class. Example:

     A
     1 2
     A
